 # Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Victor. ### PT-BR

## I'm currently learning React and typescript, but i training HTML,CSS and JS.
I like the creative part in web design, and i initiated in programmation why i'm felt limited in wordpress.

## My nemesis is create a rich text ðŸ˜„
Never was soo hard create a rich text in JS, 10x0 rich text for my. 
My idea in rich text was creating but not using execCommand, I can create editable <div> and transform all text, with italics() for example, or one word in div with split() and italics(), but if I want transform 1 letter?, i'm split all letter in a text? i trying this, but this create bug, very bugs. if i transform 1 letter and other not, after select all text and transform, eventually he transform html, and this generated "noise" in text. and is possible erase but is a bug, in my face, calling my name, cursing my family.
